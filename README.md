On the Internet I’m better known by the name “Marty McFly” or nowadays just “Marty”, developing graphics modifications for various video games, most notably in recent time the ReShade Ray Traced Global Illumination Shader (“RTGI”). My work contributed to a countless amount of other mods, has been featured by lots of gaming magazines all over the world and can even be found in the NVIDIA Driver.
